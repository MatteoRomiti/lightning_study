# Security and Privacy Analysis

In the following steps, we analyse the implications of our results from a security and privacy perspective.
## 1. Channel Capacity Perspective
`01_channel_capacity.ipynb` allows you to

- Compute entity (cluster) capacity shares (a.k.a. wealth distribution)
- Impact of Griefing attacks
- Component disintegration
- Average maximum flow with uniform random sampling
- Expected payment success ratio
- Combine results and plot

## 2. Payment Perspective
`02_payment.ipynb` allows you to

- Compute attack potential for paths
- Extract Wormhole Statistics
- Extract Value Privacy Statistics
- Extract Relationship Anonymity Statistics
- Plot combined version of value privacy and relationship anonymity
